In this lab, you will learn and explore the following topics:

.NET basics
Web application exploitation
AV evasion
Whitelist and container escapes
Pivoting
Operating with a C2 (Command and Control) Framework
Post-Exploitation
Situational Awareness
Active Directory attacks
You will learn and exploit the following attacks and misconfigurations:

Misconfigured sub-domains

Remote code execution
Docker containers
SUID binaries
Password resets
Client-side filters
AppLocker
Vulnerable DLLs
